## **Please explain Big-O notation in simple terms.**
Big-O notation is a mathematical relationship between runtime and input. Simply put, we can use it to determine how the runtime of an algorithm scales with respect to some input. Big-O notation can express the best, worst, and average-case running time of an algorithm.

## **Describe a recent interaction with someone who was non-technical. What did you need to communicate and how did you do it?**
Some of the recent interactions that come to mind happened when I was working at Stereo D. Some of the VFX artists and supervisors would get locked out of their production accounts and would ask for help to unlock it, unaware that there was a self-serve tool made to do just that. My approach to this problem has always been the same. Without getting too technical (as most people would be uninterested and just want the problem solved) I guide them through the tool step by step, keeping it simple. I use the same method for remote troubleshooting and diagnosis aswell. Something that really helps me is the **screenshare** functionality that I use to go over the problem with thems.
